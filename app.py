        ### Overview
        
        Developed a fully-functional transformer language model from scratch, implementing the complete architecture 
        that powers modern AI systems. Created an interactive visualization application that provides unprecedented 
        insight into how transformers learn language patterns through attention mechanisms.
        
        ### Key Features
        
        - Complete PyTorch implementation of transformer architecture including self-attention mechanisms, 
          positional encoding, and feed-forward networks
        - Interactive visualization of attention patterns across different heads and layers
        - Token probability distribution analysis
        - Training progression visualization showing model learning over time
        - Streamlit-based user interface for experimentation
        
        ### Technical Details
        
        - **Framework**: PyTorch for model implementation
        - **Architecture**: 4-layer transformer with 8 attention heads
        - **Training**: Adaptive learning rate scheduling with checkpointing
        - **Visualization**: Custom attention map rendering with Streamlit
        - **Dataset**: Trained on text corpus to demonstrate language modeling capabilities
        
        ### Impact & Outcomes
        
        This project provides a rare window into the inner workings of transformer models, allowing users to see 
        exactly how attention mechanisms focus on different aspects of language. It serves as both an educational 
        tool and a practical implementation reference.
